1. Stream Basics
What is a Stream?
A stream represents a flow of data (input or output).
Examples include cin (input from the keyboard) and cout (output to the console).
Advantages:
Simplicity: Easy to use for data I/O.
Operator Overloading: Operators like << (insertion) and >> (extraction) are overloaded for convenient input/output.
